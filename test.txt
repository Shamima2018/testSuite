Unit Tests:
A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.
- Expect multiplication(2,3) to be a number
- Expect multiplication(2,3) to be 6
- Expect multiplication(a,3) to be an error

A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.
Example: concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1])
...should result in [-1, 1, 3, 9, 15]
- Expect [3,4,2] , [7,4,1] to be a number
- Expect [3,4,2] , [7,4,1] to be a [1,3,7]
- Expect [0] , [0,2,4,0,] to be []
- Expect ['9',0], [0,2] to be an error
- Expect [9, 9, 9, 3, 0], [9] to be [3,9]
